# Multi-GPU Framework for TensorFlow

Using multi-GPU framework you can run any normal tensorflow code on a multiple specified number of GPUs. The framework creates same copy of the tensorflow graph for each gpu and run parallely. The framework does not require any major change in the design of the tf graph. You can write your tensorflow code any way you want and use framework method call to enable it on multiple GPUs.

## Getting Started

This project implements LSTM and CNN using the Multi-GPU framework on MNIST data.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you will need following packages:
1. TensforFlow
2. NumPy
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
